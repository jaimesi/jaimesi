## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, welcome to my GitHub!

I'm **Jaime**, a frontend developer based in Boston, MA, with a passion for accessibility, design, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). My background in film and communications has shaped how I approach the web, allowing me to blend creativity and functionality, while also leveraging my skills in **social media**, **photography**, and **videography**.

### ðŸ’» What I'm working on:
- **Languages/Frameworks**: Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the Adobe Creative Suite, and Figma.
- **Projects**: Currently building an app designed for solo female travelers, focusing on creating a safe and user-friendly experience.
- **Tech Interests**: Always diving deeper into web accessibility and inclusive design, ensuring that the web is a place everyone can navigate easily and equitably.

### ðŸŒ± Currently learning:
- Expanding my skills in AWS and cloud computing.
- Balancing my coding journey with becoming an amateur chef, because life's all about variety.

### ðŸŽ¨ Outside of tech:
When I'm not coding, you can find me playing and writing music, travelling to new states, or hosting wine and paint nights with friends. Iâ€™m also in the process of writing my first musical and love discussing Broadway showsâ€”feel free to share your favorites!

### ðŸ“« Get in touch:
- Letâ€™s collaborate, chat, or geek out over tech or anything else! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaimesi/).

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding (or adventuring)! ðŸ˜„
